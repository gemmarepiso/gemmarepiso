I am a Professora Lectora (Assistant Professor) in the Departament de Filologia Catalana at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. My main interests lie in laboratory phonology, heritage languages, and bilingual child language acquisition. Using quantitative approaches, I conduct research on the development of speech sounds and phonological processes in bilingual communities with migratory backgrounds, specifically those who speak heritage languages. I am particularly intrigued by how bilingual grammars evolve and the factors, both grammatical and extragrammatical, that contribute to individual variations in these grammars. My work aims to enhance our understanding of theories related to bilingual grammars.

Ongoing projects:

- The role of parental input in the production of VOT in English voiceless stops (with Katrina Blong)
- Rule application in code-switching (with Hironori Katsuda and Kie Zuraw)
- Hiatus resolution in word-external position by L3 Catalan learners (L1 English speakers) (with Annie Helms)
- Cross-linguistic effects on vowel production in child heritage speakers (with Daniel Pape)



 SSHRC Explore – Standard Research and Creative and Performing Arts Grant $6,967.00 for the project 'Examining Individual Variation in Trill Acquisition'.
