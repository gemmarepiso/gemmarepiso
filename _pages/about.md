I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics & Languages at McMaster University. My main interests are in laboratory phonology, heritage languages, and bilingual child language acquisition. Using quantitative approaches, I investigate the development of speech sounds and phonological processes in bilingual communities with migratory backgrounds (i.e., heritage language-speaking communities). In particular, I am interested in the question of how bilingual grammars develop and which are the grammatical and extragrammatical factors predicting individual variation in these grammars. My work aims at informing theories of bilingual grammars.

Ongoing projects:

- The role of parental input in the production of VOT in English voiceless stops (with Katrina Blong)
- Rule application in code-switching (with Hironori Katsuda and Kie Zuraw)
- Hiatus resolution in word-external position by L3 Catalan learners (L1 English speakers) (with Annie Helms)
- Cross-linguistic effects on vowel production in child heritage speakers (with Daniel Pape)
