I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics & Languages at McMaster University. My main interests are in laboratory phonology, heritage languages, and bilingual child language acquisition. My research sheds light on the patterns of grammar interaction by exploring the following areas:

- Vulnerable phenomena in early bilingual grammars.
- The role of age in language transfer in early bilingual grammars.
- The roles of quantity and quality of language exposure in early bilingual grammars.
