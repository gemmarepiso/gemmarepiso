title: "Empty Onset Repairs in the Semi-Spontaneous Speech of Spanish Child and Adult Heritage Speakers."
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this study I investigate whether child and adult Spanish heritage speakers (HS) use English-like strategies to repair word-external empty onsets preceded by consonants (e.g., el.#o.so ‘the (male) bear’). That is, I examine whether HS produce glottal phonation at /C#V/ junctures. I also examine whether stress predicts the use of glottal phonation to repair word-external empty onsets.'
