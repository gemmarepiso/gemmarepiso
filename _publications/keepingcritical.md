title: "Keeping a Critical Eye on Majority Language Influence: The Case of Uptalk in Heritage Spanish."
collection: publications
excerpt: 'The goal of this study is to highlight the importance of taking into account variations in monolingual grammars before discussing majority language influence as a possible source of heritage speakersâ€™ divergent grammars. In this study, we examine the production of uptalk in Spanish by heritage speakers of Mexican Spanish in Southern California. Uptalk (i.e., rising intonation contour at the end of a non-question utterance) is frequently associated with California English. '
