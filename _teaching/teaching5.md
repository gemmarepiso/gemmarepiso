This course is an introduction to the phonological structure of language. We will build on concepts such as phonemes, allophones, distinctive features, rules, syllabification,
and stress to familiarize students with the principles of phonological analysis. 
In addition, we will examine the interaction between phonology and other areas of the language faculty, 
such as morphology or syntax, and discuss the notion of abstractness in phonology.
By being presented with phonological data on a wide range of languages, students will learn to describe 
phonological alternations, formulate hypotheses on phonological processes, 
write and interpret rule notation, analyze syllabification, stress and intonational systems.
