In this course students will learn to describe cognitive processes involved in speech perception, word recognition and sentence
comprehension, examine (describe and evaluate) experimental methods from behavioural psychology for investigating
language comprehension, interpret experimental data to investigate language comprehension, and implement research methods in psycholinguistics by designing a research experiment on speech perception, speech production, word learning or sentence parsing.
