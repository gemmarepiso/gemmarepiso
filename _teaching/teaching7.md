This is an introductory course to common statistical methods used in linguistics research. Students will learn how to design research projects in order to statistically analyse their results. To do so, students will learn how to formulate hypotheses, determine types of variables, describe central tendency and variance of the data, and select and apply the most appropriate statistical tests for each type of hypothesis, variable, and data distribution. Moreover, students will learn how to use R to conduct statistics research. This class will cover the following statistical methods: chi-square tests, correlation, parametric tests, non-parametric-tests, ANOVAs, and regression.
