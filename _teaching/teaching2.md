The objective of this course is to become familiar with the fundamentals of programming and apply them to linguistic research. 
Students will be trained in conceptual and practical aspects of programming using R to tackle practical issues that arise in linguistic research. 
By the end of the course, students will be able to identify a programmable problem, determine the necessary steps to achieve a solution, 
apply common programming techniques, and evaluate the results of the output.
