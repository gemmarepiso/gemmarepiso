The objective of this course is to become familiar with the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and analysis of corpora using the R language. 
Students will be trained in conceptual and practical aspects of corpus analysis using R and the package quanteda.
By the end of the course, students will be able to compile and annotate textual corpora, 
use a variety of corpus tools to perform searches and return lexical frequency lists, concordances, etc., visualize linguistic patterns in corpora, and carry out a small-scale-corpus-based research project.
