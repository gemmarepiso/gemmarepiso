Over my years as a lecturer at UCLA, I have collaborated in several projects to better understand the demographic characteristics of my students.
The results of these projects have resulted in the following publications:

Manuel-Oronich, R., Repiso-Puigdelliura, G., & Tudela-Isanta, A. (2021). Motivations to learn Catalan outside the Catalan-speaking community: factors and affecting variables. International Journal of Multilingualism, 1-16. https://raco.cat/index.php/TSC/article/view/374466

Tudela-Isanta, A., Arráez, J. V., Puigdelliura, G. R., & Oronich, R. M. (2020). Característiques de l’alumnat de català L2 fora del domini lingüístic. Treballs de sociolingüística catalana, 39-55. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14790718.2021.1963259
